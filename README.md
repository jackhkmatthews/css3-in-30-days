## Learnings

- CSS variable funcitons take an option second argument to be used as a fallback
- unlike fixed elements who's dimensions are relative to the viewport, sticky positioned element's dimensions are relative to their parents e.g. `width: 100%` and `height: 100%` are relative to parent and not viewport.
